# Setting Up

## VS Code Setup
We'll be using Visual Studio Code (VS Code) as our code editor. You can [download VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) directly from its website.

Then, let's open VS Code and create a new HTML file:

1. Select "File" > "New File"
2. Save the file as **index.html**

Let's enter the following starter code in the **index.html** file:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head></head>
  <body></body>
</html>
```
